# ⚔ Welcome Adventurer to the Uncounted Isles! ⚔

You are a greenhorn adventurer sent to the Uncounted Isles to deal with all the quests that the higher-ranked adventurers keep ignoring. Fight rats, bandits, the undead and more. Search for missing items or villagers. Dive into dungeons that threaten villages. You can choose which quests to take or to skip.

Find loot and trade with villagers to get the perfect equipment for your fighting style. Sling spells or fight with a sword and shield to gain more experience and make a name for yourself.

The adventurers guild was generous enough to grant you a death crystal for your troubles. Now dying just hurts (a lot) and you will lose any items or coins you took on an adventure. But on the bright side, you will awake in your safehouse should you die in a combat encounter.

**This little voxel first-person fantasy roguelite RPG is currently being built by a solo dev with a custom game engine. So, it will be some time till release. If you think this looks neat and would like to be kept up to date, feel free to wishlist on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012030/Uncounted_Isles/) or follow me on [Twitter](twitter.com/OtterSpaceDev) / [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@OtterSpaceDev).**
